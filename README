This chat client/server is intended to have a IRC type flavor, although 
implemented differently.

There are several modes that can be set on a user:
o = Owner, all privileges
a = Admin, most privileges (except for changing Admin flags)
m = Moderator, most Admin privileges except for changing Admin and Banned flags
t = Trusted, just a mark of respect
q = Quiet, can only speak in asides
s = Silent, cannot talk at all
b = Banned.

[This README will be recompleted after I recover from the shock of deleting my 
only copy]
